# ipa_pwexpiry
This Python script may be useful for FreeIPA admins.
All others may consider it an example of mediocre Python programming.
It queries IPA's LDAP database and shows a list of users with password expiry date.
Optionally sends warning mails to users with password about to expire.
You will need to modify the source code to make it work. Meant to be used with cron.
